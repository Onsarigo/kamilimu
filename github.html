          <h2> Need For Open-Source </h2>
          <p>
            The aim of open source is to foster collaboration and innovation by making software and its source code freely available to the public. This approach encourages a diverse community of developers to contribute, improve, and customize the software, enhancing transparency, security, and trust. Open source accelerates the development of new features and technologies, makes high-quality software accessible to everyone, and provides valuable learning opportunities. Ultimately, it builds a supportive network of users and developers who drive projects forward collectively, ensuring long-term stability and growth.
